                                    <p>In the last 12 months, COVID-19 and wildfires reminded us that government can’t
                                        meet people’s needs without easy to use, reliable and secure technology. Often,
                                        the services provided by government are the difference between life and death.
                                        When these services fell short, state staff and technology company partners
                                        responded with creativity and dedication, moving quickly and deliberately to
                                        deliver improvements.</p>

                                    <p>Californians must be able to trust their government. We earn that trust by making
                                        sure government services are reliable and dependable.</p>

                                    <blockquote>
                                        <p>“Automation is here, it’s reusable, and should be easy to apply. Any
                                            department that’s still touching paper has to move past it.”

                                            Operations, Employment Development Department</p>
                                    </blockquote>

                                    <p>Faster public services means learning how to identify bottlenecks in not just
                                        public services, but internal processes, too. To enable state staff to focus on
                                        putting people first, we must look for bottlenecks in our processes and
                                        policies, and rewrite them to be simpler, clearer and more straightforward.</p>

                                    <p>We’ve seen and heard that the quality of our public services is inconsistent.
                                        Before COVID-19, some services could only be applied for in person. Some
                                        services can be used online, but at a computer, not on a phone. In others,
                                        people keep entering the wrong information, showing the need to make services
                                        easier to understand and use. Policies often mean services are delivered slowly
                                        because they don’t allow automation, or automation is used but inconsistently.
                                        Many people aren’t confident enough to use online services, and find them

                                    <p>In California, nearly 16 million Californians speak a language instead of English
                                        or in addition to English. But many public services can appear to people as if
                                        they are designed for upper-middle-class, English speaking people first, and as
                                        if the most vulnerable Californians as an afterthought.</p>

                                    <p>Around 23% of adult Californians have some kind of disability. Throughout our
                                        lives, most of us will experience disability, whether permanently or
                                        temporarily. Assembly Bill 434 recognized this, by requiring government websites
                                        to comply with industry and federal accessibility standards. But being inclusive
                                        and accessible to all is more complicated than complying with rules.</p>

                                    <p>COVID-19 illustrated how changes to procurement – dropping the requirement for
                                        vendors to be on-site – opened up the state to vendors who are normally
                                        excluded.</p>

                                    <p>Technology supporting equity and inclusion means services are just as easy and
                                        fast for Sofia to use with English as a second language and limited mobility.
                                        Leticia and Gina, with their three children have internet access that’s
                                        affordable, fast and reliable enough if working from home or home schooling.
                                        Widespread internet access means Erika gets her fishing permit from her phone at
                                        the river, instead of needing to remember to get it before she drives out in the
                                        morning.</p>

                                    <p>When diverse teams and vendors representative of our State are supported to
                                        research and listen to people like Sofia, Leticia, Gina and Erika from the start
                                        of their work, our public services will better reflect and meet the needs of the
                                        people they serve.</p>

                                    <p>When we examined large technology projects in planning (in the Project Approval
                                        Lifecycle, PAL) across the state we found 79 case management systems across 22
                                        departments; 45 reporting systems across 15 departments; 27 licensing systems

                                        content management systems across 10 departments.</p>

                                    <p>Pooling investment into shared digital infrastructure that we use across the
                                        state will make it easier for us to build expertise in working at scale, easier
                                        and faster for teams to apply shared experience and patterns to solve problems,
                                        and provide more time and resources for programs to focus on solving the unique
                                        problems they face in meeting people’s needs rather than managing duplicative,
                                        overlapping, and often redundant technology.</p>

                                    <p>In departments, this will mean meeting people’s needs like uploading documents,
                                        providing helpdesk and support services, and verifying people’s identity

                                    <p>Staff in different departments need to be able to find each other in seconds,

                                    <p>Centralizing and standardizing on commodities makes it easier for us to take
                                        advantage of our scale as the world’s fifth-largest economy, using our size to
                                        deliver better services at a responsible cost, allowing us to use our public
                                        funds to better serve people, instead of maintaining redundant technology.</p>

                                    <p>Most importantly, achieving this goal will make it faster and easier for teams to
                                        solve actual Californians’ problems and serve their needs, such as receiving
                                        emergency grant funding, starting businesses, or finding child care.</p>

                                    <p>The COVID-19 pandemic forced our government to adapt quickly and rethink how we
                                        serve 40 million Californians. At the same time, the 2020-2021 budget has less
                                        funding for government services, and requires government to work more
                                        efficiently.</p>

                                    <p>In our research and engagement, we found departments hungry to use technology to
                                        dramatically improve operations, services and outcomes. And yet, technology is
                                        not doing as much as it should. Leaders and implementers face significant
                                        challenges effectively making these improvements quickly and effectively.</p>

                                    <p>As well as needing project initiation, budgeting procurement and oversight to
                                        better support how commodity and shared services can quickly solve problems and
                                        meet people’s needs, the same policies and processes need to support the
                                        distinct needs of large, complex programs. We heard this across agencies,
                                        departments, legislative staff and the Legislative Analyst’s Office.</p>

                                    <p>These large complex programs usually involve older technology infrastructure
                                        (“legacy” technology, often running on state mainframes). Achieving our vision
                                        requires successful, replicable approaches so these kinds of technology can
                                        quickly and efficiently meet people’s continually changing needs.</p>

                                    <p>Lastly, we found a common need to be organized for continuous learning. Making
                                        success easy to copy, and making failures easy to learn from, is key to building
                                        digital government more quickly, and more effectively.</p>

                                        technical jargon, and not knowing what’s possible and where to start, but being
                                        eager and willing to learn.</p>

                                    <p>All state staff shared the need for an environment that supports learning and of
                                        the need for consistent support and guidance. Empowered teams need places that
                                        are safe to learn, where they can speak up, test new ideas and have difficult
                                        conversations. This means changing our attitude to risk, because failure is
                                        necessary to learn.</p>

                                    <p>We also heard loudly that progress means bringing new skills, experience and
                                        talent into government. New, critical services like COVID-19 notifications were
                                        only possible because designers, user researchers, data engineers and more were
                                        brought into our teams.</p>

                                    <p>The vendor community is a critical part of forming these teams. When COVID-19
                                        forced the state to drop the requirement for vendors to be on-site, it became
                                        easier for the state to acquire skills, significantly increased the pool of
                                        vendors to collaborate with, and allowed the state to experiment with
                                        understanding what type of skills might best be met through staff.</p>

                                    <p>Departments and teams have been successful where disciplines deliberately worked
                                        together across silos and organizing around common goals, from bottom up, and
                                        from the executive level down.</p>

                                    <p>In the end, our people and teams are those who do the work. Together, they will
                                        build the infrastructure we need, understand the problems that need solving, and
                                        deliver our vision of compassionate, human-centered, effective and efficient
                                        government.</p>
