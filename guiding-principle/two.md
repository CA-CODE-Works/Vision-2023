# 2. Continuous, timely improvement 

**In 2020, putting people first meant adaptable and flexible public services.**

Taking months or years to improve public services would have been catastrophic during a crisis. 

Government is successful at meeting peopleâ€™s needs when steady, frequent improvement is planned for, supported and delivered. Visible, continuous improvement also builds transparency, accountability and trust. 

Focusing on continuous, timely improvement means systems and services that can be updated and improved every day, instead of in months or years. It means people benefit from their needs being met timely and quickly because we choose usable solutions that can be deployed at speed.
