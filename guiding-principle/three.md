# 3. Working together beats working alone  
People shouldn’t need to understand how government departments are organized to get the help and information they need. The services and information we design and deliver must be holistic and work together, instead of feeling unconnected and like a maze. 

In 2020, we saw the best of public service when small multi-disciplinary teams came together from different departments and agencies. 

These teams included program managers and analysts, product managers, engineers, designers and user researchers, operations managers, data scientists and data engineers, claims processors, executives and more. 

These teams came together as state staff, civic technologists and from the vendor community. 

And they succeeded in designing and delivering compassionate, human-centered services because together they focused on understanding what people need and meeting those needs through fast feedback and solving problems.

The COVID-19 pandemic also taught us that we don’t need to be in the same physical room, like we have in the past. Opening us up to more diverse collaborators and engagement with the public brought new insights and new approaches to solving problems. 

When every discipline needed to deliver a service works together, on equal footing, with a common goal in sight, we stand the best chance of putting people first, improving continuously, and bringing our vision to life.
