# 1. Put people first

**In 2020, doing our job required us to focus on putting people first.**

Putting people first meant the public could continue to receive services, while staggering numbers of public servants were able to do their jobs from home, many for the first time, and within days. 

Putting people first meant Californians could access the public health information they needed, quickly, clearly and simply, when a multi-disciplinary team spanning departments and agencies built and continuously improved the [covid19.ca.gov](https://covid19.ca.gov/) website.

This year, across government, we rediscovered the importance of checking whether our policies, processes and systems are doing the best job of putting people first, and to change them quickly and flexibly when they can be improved. 

For the public, this means focusing on understanding peopleâ€™s needs and their experience to deliver help and information they need, when they need it. This applies to our public servants, too: we cannot put the public first without understanding and delivering the technology they need to succeed.
