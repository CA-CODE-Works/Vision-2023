## 2. Ensure public services are equitable and inclusive
**Challenge 2.1: How can we ensure all Californians have access to affordable, reliable high performance broadband?**

Reasons why this challenge matters, and obstacles toward achieving this goal include: 

- 23 percent of California housing units—home to 8.4 million residents—do not have broadband subscriptions.
- There are five core roadblocks preventing Californians from accessing or adopting broadband: availability (speed and reliability), affordability, access to devices, digital skills, and data. 
- Delivering broadband to all Californians will require at least $6.8 billion in private, federal, and state investments as bandwidth demand continues to grow - far outstripping expected funding from the Federal Communication Commission’s Rural Digital Opportunity Fund and existing State programs. 
- We recognize that achieving Broadband for All will require partnerships with and support from the broadband industry and federal, municipal, and tribal governments.
- Where services have been converted to digital, lack of access means those services have become inaccessible: people can’t get fishing licenses if fishing licenses are digital and there is no internet access. 

**Challenge 2.2: How can we make digital services and information accessible to everyone?**

Reasons why this challenge matters, and obstacles toward achieving this goal include: 

- It is imperative that all Californians can access government services
- Digital is increasingly the primary channel and expected channel for government services
- Strict compliance with AB434 and industry accessibility standards does not automatically result in increased accessibility or improved outcomes to real users.  
- Most of us will at some point have a disability or become elderly
- Many services are inaccessible to those who speak English as a second language, or do not speak English at all. 

**Challenge 2.3: How might we better reflect the diversity of California in the teams building technology for California?**

Reasons why this challenge matters, and obstacles toward achieving this goal include: 

- Having more diverse government workforces - in terms of sex, race, ethnicity, language, ability, and experience - leads to better policy outcomes for represented communities. Diverse workforces with diverse life experience are better able to understand people’s needs. 
- Diverse workplaces with a focus on eliminating barriers to inclusion help attract and retain the best talent from a wider pool.  
- Diversity leads to more innovation and better decision-making by leveraging more, different perspectives. 
- Our State Technology workforce does not yet reflect the state we serve, particularly amongst women (35% of workforce vs. 50% of population) and Hispanic or Latino colleagues (12% of workforce vs. 39% of population). 

**Challenge 2.4 How can we create an equitable, inclusive and diverse playing field for technology purchases attracting the best technology vendors?**

Reasons why this challenge matters, and obstacles toward achieving this goal include: 

- In general, A technology policy and procurement environment incentivizing large technology procurements (e.g. tens or hundreds of millions of dollars), combined with factors such as unexamined mandatory requirements, results in a small, repetitive pool of eligible vendors, restricting competition and the ability of the state to achieve the best results. 
- Default approaches to tech procurements can in effect encourage the choice of large, established vendors even when not warranted.
- By opening up procurements can get better solutions and more diverse vendor pool.
- Vendors face barriers in deciding whether to compete or bid to work with the state: both prospective and established vendors had trouble finding out about opportunities to bid. 
- Newer, smaller and typically more diverse vendors face barriers in insurance requirements and setup requirements such as on-premise servers, or requiring vendor staff to be full-time on-site in a CA government facility in the Sacramento area.
- Smaller, less-capitalized vendors are less likely to submit bids due to longer payment terms (Net 60 or Net 90 compared to Net 30, which is common in the private sector), resulting in less competition.
- Many procurements require an all-paper process, including mailing or delivering paper responses, restricting access.  
- Even for established vendors, the repetitive work involved in completing solicitation paperwork on successive procurements is a barrier. This is even more burdensome for newer, smaller and typically more diverse vendors.
- Vendors feel constrained and disincentivized to bid due to solicitations focused on already-determined solutions. Newer, smaller vendors able to offer more innovative responses to requests that outlined problems and needs in plain language are discouraged from doing business with the state.
- The state is likely missing opportunities for both learning and savings by not making most solicitations open source by default, or allowing successful vendor partnerships to expand across departments.
