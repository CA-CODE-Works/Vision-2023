### 1. Deliver easy to use, fast, dependable and secure public services
 **Challenge 1.1: How might we make it easier to understand and navigate public services and information?**
 
 Reasons why this challenge matters, and obstacles toward achieving this goal include:

 - Public services and the information people need is delivered over three hundred websites managed by over 150 government departments, contributing to inconsistency. 
 - The user experience of California state websites is disconnected and inconsistent, with poor speed and performance common, especially for people using mobile devices.
 - Services don’t always meet the public where they are in terms of mobile devices and interfaces (usually because they were designed for desktop web browsers).
 - Many services require high reading levels in English, and significant administrative understanding and technology savvy to interact with.

 **Challenge 1.2: How might we make strike teams a thing of the past? What must we do to ensure critical public services and technology infrastructure are ready for surges, and are resilient and dependable?** 

Reasons why this challenge matters, and obstacles toward achieving this goal include:

 - Many critical public services rely on legacy technology systems, many of which have seen chronic underinvestment, making them inflexible and unable to meet surge demand.
 - Outages in the last several years have led to emergency incidents and strike teams to stabilize and address dramatic service failures that have occurred at the confluence of operations, policy, and technology. Strike teams aren’t sustainable, and are reactive. 
 - Today, there are critical public services whose digital services are only available during certain office hours, instead of being available 24/7. 
 - We must get ahead of the next crisis, and make regular progress to stabilize and improve resilience of critical services so we don’t need strike teams again.
 - COVID has shown that surges in demand will happen. Critical public services must be ready and regularly tested to meet increases in peak demand.   
 - Programs often lack the operational insights, dashboards or metrics to identify where policy, operations and use of technology must change to meet surges. 

 **Challenge 1.3: How might we provide faster, more accurate, and more consistent public services?**
 
 Reasons why this challenge matters, and obstacles toward achieving this goal include: 

 - Digital services are inconsistently implemented, making it hard to share and reuse data which is frustrating to users, inefficient for government, and can lead to inaccuracies.
 - During COVID, some services were still transitioning to online portals, while others could only convert paper, form-based applications to emails.
 - People aren’t receiving services in a timely manner. This is often because a combination of policy and technology is relying on paper documentation, or assuming that paper documentation must be provided. 
 - Few people want to spend more time with their government. The faster a service is provided, the happier people are with their government. 
 - Processing errors undermine confidence, generate re-work, and cause frustration. 
 - Inconsistency can lead to questions of bias, capriciousness, and fairness. 
 - Manual steps tend to bottleneck processes, slowing down services, introducing variance, and frustrating staff who want to focus on more meaningful work. Many of these manual steps might not be needed. 
 - Programs often lack the operational insights, dashboards or metrics to identify opportunities to change policy and operations, improve technology, and use automation. Without this information, programs are unable to prioritize changes.
