## 4. Build digital government more quickly and more effectively  
**Challenge 4.1 How can we provide practical, consistent and transparent technology project initiation and oversight that meets different stakeholder needs, from ongoing service improvement to a state-wide enterprise view for prioritization?** 

Reasons why this challenge matters, and obstacles toward achieving this goal include: 

 - Managers and CIOs expressed a desire for faster, clearer, and more lightweight project approval cycles. Delegation thresholds aren’t perceived to be set at appropriate levels. 
 - The current project initiation and oversight process is cumbersome and intrusive, which slows down the state’s ability to provide services and use modern technology. For technology implementations, this makes the difference between getting a current or an old technology.
 - Interviews with legislative staff indicated that too many improvement initiatives measure in years before changes are put into production.
 - Approval processes would be better with more coaching, consistency, and adaptability so outcomes are less dependent on individuals.
 - Project leaders need investment and support to ensure they have the right capabilities, and knowledge including from those who have led similar builds. 

**Challenge 4.2: How might we develop the information needed to create and update a state-wide roadmap, and to prioritize investment?** 

Reasons why this challenge matters, and obstacles toward achieving this goal include: 

 - The Department of Finance and the Legislature need regular visibility and confidence that we are appropriately investing and building useful technology at both the service and state-wide enterprise level.
 - An environment focused on projects has left no room to identify or support state-wide common infrastructure or shared services that would provide compound benefits for multiple projects.

**Challenge 4.3: How might we better solve large, complex, state-wide problems like legacy infrastructure modernization and long-term harmonization of infrastructure?**

Reasons why this challenge matters, and obstacles toward achieving this goal include:

- Technology leaders expressed the need to distinguish between projects that require treatment as technology capital projects and those suited for continuous service improvement.
- Successful public and private approaches to solving large, complex, duplicated problems like operational data exchange involve solving immediate, practical problems one-by-one as part of a deliberate long-term strategy. 

**Challenge 4.4: How can we stop re-learning the same lessons? How can we accelerate progress by institutionalizing learning?**

Reasons why this challenge matters, and obstacles toward achieving this goal include: 

- There is no consistent, prioritized or adequately resourced approach to creating the technical documentation and guidance to support learning from project to project. This is required for the state to make the exponential improvement for Vision 2023. 
- Technology leaders clearly expressed the need for projects to build and apply lessons from each others’ success and failures. 
- Critical systems rely on the outstanding work of long-term government staff who are nearing retirement.
