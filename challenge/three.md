## 3. Make common technology easy to access, use, share and reuse across government
**Challenge 3.1: What standard technology, tools and policy do government staff need to succeed, and how might we make those tools easy to access and use across government?**

Reasons why this challenge matters, and obstacles toward achieving this goal include: 

 - Staff can’t easily look up each other’s contact information or availability, real-time collaboration tools are replicating agency and department boundaries and staff are frustrated by spending time emailing documents, instead of being able to work on documents together in real-time.
 - State agencies and workers don’t have a ​shared baseline of technology​ available to them, and have difficulty collaborating and sharing data across agencies that use different technology.
 - Access and availability to broadband internet in homes (and in some cases workplaces) is inconsistent. 
 - Laptop computers, cameras, and smartphones are the basics of a work style that requires remote conferencing and expects communication from anywhere, but our survey found ~35% of staff have a computer or phone that can be used for video meetings while teleworking.
 - Staff input and participation in technology decisions and ensuring staff technology needs are met can be improved: most staff felt that people choosing the technology they use and is available to them only somewhat understood their jobs (48%) or not at all (21%).
 - With increasing and complex security requirements, staff need support like password management software to be available by default.
 - Initiatives like the Data Tool Programs have identified the need for easy access and availability of standard modern data tools, this program needs cross-governmental support and collaboration tools as well. 
 - Inconsistent policies, from security to project management to procurement means industry standard tools (e.g., for surveys, project management) used in one department or program, are prohibited by others from procurement, or even prohibited from access. Successful procurement, timely of a tool often depends on finding an example where it is used elsewhere.
 - Lack of consistency in standards and IT infrastructure has reinforces silos and inhibits collaboration and multi-disciplinary teams. 
 - Continuous, timely improvement requires timely availability of tools.

**Challenge 3.2: What do we need to change so that it is easier to successfully use common technology?** 

Reasons why this challenge matters, and obstacles toward achieving this goal include: 

 - The state is not learning fast enough. Lessons learned from one project are not easily available to a project by a different group, and both regulatory and cultural barriers prevent groups from copying each other’s successful procurement and development work, so even common technology can be difficult to apply successfully. People who have been involved in similar projects are not involved in supporting the success of subsequent projects. 
 - Technology and procurement policy are experienced as “one size fits all”. Needs and problems that might easily be solved with common, standard policy or infrastructure can easily become large technology projects, even when that may not be appropriate. For example, there are many duplicate common systems (e.g. Case Management) currently in PAL that may not require so much duplication. 
 - Departments need clear, consistent policies regarding data, the use of cloud services and graded approaches to risk.  
 - Departments often negotiate their own deals for commodity technology, despite largely common needs across the state; taking precious time and resources away from other priorities.
 - Leaders recognize a need for strong institutional focus  and support for what makes programs or departmental needs exceptional instead of what is common.
The state has a unique opportunity through its size, scope and partnerships with other California entities such as local government to negotiate better value. 
 - Departments have found success and utility with vehicles like CDT’s Vendor Hosted Subscription Services (VHSS) and DGS’ Software Licensing Program (SLP) that have made it easier to buy common technology.

**Challenge 3.3: What do staff need to easily use and access the data they need? How might policy, technology, tools and infrastructure need to change to support those needs?** 

Reasons why this challenge matters, and obstacles toward achieving this goal include: 

 - Emergencies like successfully coordinating seamless evacuation require entities like CalOES, county sheriffs and emergency operations centers to share situational awareness that isn’t supported by current data infrastructure. 
 - The needs of program staff such as data scientists and analysts in terms of policy, tools, systems and infrastructure aren’t clearly understood and so their needs are not being met consistently and efficiently. 
 - Programs lack consistent, secure environments to prototype and experiment with data without affecting operations, and consistent, automated methods of deploying to production. 
 - An inconsistent, crisis-driven approach means many data problems are solved on an ad-hoc basis instead of systemically. This crisis or project driven approach means there is little to no opportunity for institutional continuous learning, and high start up costs. 
 - Across the state, processes and governance need to be harmonized so that usage, access and control of data is consistent and clear.

**Challenge 3.4: How might we reduce the burden on departments by improving the reliability, simplifying maintenance and reducing the cost of running websites?** 

Reasons why this challenge matters, and obstacles toward achieving this goal include: 

 - Commodity web hosting and publishing Infrastructure is duplicated across departments and a potential ideal candidate for standardization and centralization.
 - Public websites aren’t consistent in their ability to meet surges in demand.
 - Inconsistent web platforms, templates, and design across the state, lead to complex operations and variable user experience for Californians. 

**Challenge 3.5: How can we develop a more secure, reliable and seamless way for people to prove who they are across the State?** 

Reasons why this challenge matters, and obstacles toward achieving this goal include: 

 - The user experience of identity verification and authentication is inconsistent across services, and does not reflect the expectations of users, who see government as a single entity. 
 - Dozens of identification verification solutions exist statewide. 
 - Breakdowns in the intersection of policy, operations and technology in identity verification have created operational bottlenecks leading to unacceptably slow service delivery.
 - Work needs to be done to understand user needs and expectations about how and when government shares information, transparency and informed consent, and to develop and implement successful patterns.
 - All users and stakeholders have a right and expectation to privacy and security of their information.
