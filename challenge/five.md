## 5. Build confident, empowered multi-disciplinary teams
**Challenge 5.1: What do leaders need to confidently and successfully integrate program, operations and technology to continuously improve outcomes?** 

Reasons why this challenge matters, and obstacles toward achieving this goal include: 

- Executives and leaders need the confidence, support, environment and skills to lead business, operational and service transformations that are impossible without solid technology execution. 
- Limited fluency can hold back departmental progress and reinforce silos.
- Insufficient support models and practices exist today, and surveys and interviews indicate that management training doesn’t fully incorporate technology or address the needs of busy state leaders. 
- Poorly implemented and resourced technology rollouts sow distrust in new projects and approaches. 
- Siloed technology teams can at times run their own projects without a clear understanding of the business needs behind them, or sometimes vendors step in and end up driving strategy; inevitably, disconnected technology teams have their own concerns and priorities which may or may not align directly with agency priorities.

**Challenge 5.2: How can we begin building stronger, integrated, multi-disciplinary teams?** 

Reasons why this challenge matters, and obstacles toward achieving this goal include: 

- Technology is not an end in itself but rather a tool to help improve government - and successful use requires collaboration and integration across disciplines.
- We currently organize technology largely based on a historical IT structure where there is a need to “keep the lights on” and support commodity technology, even as roles have increasingly intertwined with core programs. 
- We need to show how to incorporate technology into integrated teams to help enable the type of collaborative work required to deliver. 
- Where agencies rely heavily on vendors, they often underestimate the internal technology skills needed, and just the volume of management work required for vendor projects to succeed. Managers can be effectively assigned to two jobs while a major technology project is in play: their existing responsibilities, and management of the technology project.

**Challenge 5.3: How can we better invest in and develop our technologists?**

Reasons why this challenge matters, and obstacles toward achieving this goal include: 

- Strong existing technology leadership programs exist throughout the state but surveys indicate that they don’t fully meet current needs and there are gaps in the skills and training they provide, including on-the-job learning.
- Competency models and job descriptions are inconsistent in practice. Some of this work has already started in areas like data.  
- Staff and managers are eager for additional training, and reported confidence in their ability to adapt to new technology with proper training.
- Staff feel that systems are forced on them with little or inadequate training.

**Challenge 5.4: How can we attract and retain the technology talent needed for 21st century government?**

Reasons why this challenge matters, and obstacles toward achieving this goal include: 

- We lack critical roles like user researchers, designers, technical writers and data engineers to achieve our goals and vision, and these roles are also hard to recruit for. 
- Rapid changes in technologies are changing the way we live and work - and we need the talent to help government keep up with these changes.
- Need to attract talent with a value proposition focused on service, recognizing what government can uniquely offer compared to the private sector. 
- Need to set up non-governmental talent for success by thoughtfully onboarding and integrating talent into teams with appropriate support to avoid the risk of burn out.
- When technology is not part of the hiring budgeting and planning process, technology disciplines may not be expanded enough to support the new functions or headcount.
