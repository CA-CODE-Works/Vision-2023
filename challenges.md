# Challenge Statements

### 1. Deliver easy to use, fast, dependable and secure public services
 **Challenge 1.1: How might we make it easier to understand and navigate public services and information?**
 Reasons why this challenge matters, and obstacles toward achieving this goal include:
 - Public services and the information people need is delivered over three hundred websites managed by over 150 government departments, contributing to inconsistency. 
 - The user experience of California state websites is disconnected and inconsistent, with poor speed and performance common, especially for people using mobile devices.
 - Services don’t always meet the public where they are in terms of mobile devices and interfaces (usually because they were designed for desktop web browsers).
 - Many services require high reading levels in English, and significant administrative understanding and technology savvy to interact with.

 **Challenge 1.2: How might we make strike teams a thing of the past? What must we do to ensure critical public services and technology infrastructure are ready for surges, and are resilient and dependable?** 
Reasons why this challenge matters, and obstacles toward achieving this goal include:

 - Many critical public services rely on legacy technology systems, many of which have seen chronic underinvestment, making them inflexible and unable to meet surge demand.
 - Outages in the last several years have led to emergency incidents and strike teams to stabilize and address dramatic service failures that have occurred at the confluence of operations, policy, and technology. Strike teams aren’t sustainable, and are reactive. 
 - Today, there are critical public services whose digital services are only available during certain office hours, instead of being available 24/7. 
 - We must get ahead of the next crisis, and make regular progress to stabilize and improve resilience of critical services so we don’t need strike teams again.
 - COVID has shown that surges in demand will happen. Critical public services must be ready and regularly tested to meet increases in peak demand.   
 - Programs often lack the operational insights, dashboards or metrics to identify where policy, operations and use of technology must change to meet surges. 

 **Challenge 1.3: How might we provide faster, more accurate, and more consistent public services?**
 Reasons why this challenge matters, and obstacles toward achieving this goal include: 

 - Digital services are inconsistently implemented, making it hard to share and reuse data which is frustrating to users, inefficient for government, and can lead to inaccuracies.
 - During COVID, some services were still transitioning to online portals, while others could only convert paper, form-based applications to emails.
 - People aren’t receiving services in a timely manner. This is often because a combination of policy and technology is relying on paper documentation, or assuming that paper documentation must be provided. 
 - Few people want to spend more time with their government. The faster a service is provided, the happier people are with their government. 
 - Processing errors undermine confidence, generate re-work, and cause frustration. 
 - Inconsistency can lead to questions of bias, capriciousness, and fairness. 
 - Manual steps tend to bottleneck processes, slowing down services, introducing variance, and frustrating staff who want to focus on more meaningful work. Many of these manual steps might not be needed. 
 - Programs often lack the operational insights, dashboards or metrics to identify opportunities to change policy and operations, improve technology, and use automation. Without this information, programs are unable to prioritize changes.
 
## 2. Ensure public services are equitable and inclusive
**Challenge 2.1: How can we ensure all Californians have access to affordable, reliable high performance broadband?**
Reasons why this challenge matters, and obstacles toward achieving this goal include: 

- 23 percent of California housing units—home to 8.4 million residents—do not have broadband subscriptions.
- There are five core roadblocks preventing Californians from accessing or adopting broadband: availability (speed and reliability), affordability, access to devices, digital skills, and data. 
- Delivering broadband to all Californians will require at least $6.8 billion in private, federal, and state investments as bandwidth demand continues to grow - far outstripping expected funding from the Federal Communication Commission’s Rural Digital Opportunity Fund and existing State programs. 
- We recognize that achieving Broadband for All will require partnerships with and support from the broadband industry and federal, municipal, and tribal governments.
- Where services have been converted to digital, lack of access means those services have become inaccessible: people can’t get fishing licenses if fishing licenses are digital and there is no internet access. 

**Challenge 2.2: How can we make digital services and information accessible to everyone?**
Reasons why this challenge matters, and obstacles toward achieving this goal include: 

- It is imperative that all Californians can access government services
- Digital is increasingly the primary channel and expected channel for government services
- Strict compliance with AB434 and industry accessibility standards does not automatically result in increased accessibility or improved outcomes to real users.  
- Most of us will at some point have a disability or become elderly
- Many services are inaccessible to those who speak English as a second language, or do not speak English at all. 

**Challenge 2.3: How might we better reflect the diversity of California in the teams building technology for California?**
Reasons why this challenge matters, and obstacles toward achieving this goal include: 

- Having more diverse government workforces - in terms of sex, race, ethnicity, language, ability, and experience - leads to better policy outcomes for represented communities. Diverse workforces with diverse life experience are better able to understand people’s needs. 
- Diverse workplaces with a focus on eliminating barriers to inclusion help attract and retain the best talent from a wider pool.  
- Diversity leads to more innovation and better decision-making by leveraging more, different perspectives. 
- Our State Technology workforce does not yet reflect the state we serve, particularly amongst women (35% of workforce vs. 50% of population) and Hispanic or Latino colleagues (12% of workforce vs. 39% of population). 

**Challenge 2.4 How can we create an equitable, inclusive and diverse playing field for technology purchases attracting the best technology vendors?**
Reasons why this challenge matters, and obstacles toward achieving this goal include: 

- In general, A technology policy and procurement environment incentivizing large technology procurements (e.g. tens or hundreds of millions of dollars), combined with factors such as unexamined mandatory requirements, results in a small, repetitive pool of eligible vendors, restricting competition and the ability of the state to achieve the best results. 
- Default approaches to tech procurements can in effect encourage the choice of large, established vendors even when not warranted.
- By opening up procurements can get better solutions and more diverse vendor pool.
- Vendors face barriers in deciding whether to compete or bid to work with the state: both prospective and established vendors had trouble finding out about opportunities to bid. 
- Newer, smaller and typically more diverse vendors face barriers in insurance requirements and setup requirements such as on-premise servers, or requiring vendor staff to be full-time on-site in a CA government facility in the Sacramento area.
- Smaller, less-capitalized vendors are less likely to submit bids due to longer payment terms (Net 60 or Net 90 compared to Net 30, which is common in the private sector), resulting in less competition.
- Many procurements require an all-paper process, including mailing or delivering paper responses, restricting access.  
- Even for established vendors, the repetitive work involved in completing solicitation paperwork on successive procurements is a barrier. This is even more burdensome for newer, smaller and typically more diverse vendors.
- Vendors feel constrained and disincentivized to bid due to solicitations focused on already-determined solutions. Newer, smaller vendors able to offer more innovative responses to requests that outlined problems and needs in plain language are discouraged from doing business with the state.
- The state is likely missing opportunities for both learning and savings by not making most solicitations open source by default, or allowing successful vendor partnerships to expand across departments.

## 3. Make common technology easy to access, use, share and reuse across government
** Challenge 3.1: What standard technology, tools and policy do government staff need to succeed, and how might we make those tools easy to access and use across government?** 
Reasons why this challenge matters, and obstacles toward achieving this goal include: 

 - Staff can’t easily look up each other’s contact information or availability, real-time collaboration tools are replicating agency and department boundaries and staff are frustrated by spending time emailing documents, instead of being able to work on documents together in real-time.
 - State agencies and workers don’t have a ​shared baseline of technology​ available to them, and have difficulty collaborating and sharing data across agencies that use different technology.
 - Access and availability to broadband internet in homes (and in some cases workplaces) is inconsistent. 
 - Laptop computers, cameras, and smartphones are the basics of a work style that requires remote conferencing and expects communication from anywhere, but our survey found ~35% of staff have a computer or phone that can be used for video meetings while teleworking.
 - Staff input and participation in technology decisions and ensuring staff technology needs are met can be improved: most staff felt that people choosing the technology they use and is available to them only somewhat understood their jobs (48%) or not at all (21%).
 - With increasing and complex security requirements, staff need support like password management software to be available by default.
 - Initiatives like the Data Tool Programs have identified the need for easy access and availability of standard modern data tools, this program needs cross-governmental support and collaboration tools as well. 
 - Inconsistent policies, from security to project management to procurement means industry standard tools (e.g., for surveys, project management) used in one department or program, are prohibited by others from procurement, or even prohibited from access. Successful procurement, timely of a tool often depends on finding an example where it is used elsewhere.
 - Lack of consistency in standards and IT infrastructure has reinforces silos and inhibits collaboration and multi-disciplinary teams. 
 - Continuous, timely improvement requires timely availability of tools.

**Challenge 3.2: What do we need to change so that it is easier to successfully use common technology?** 
Reasons why this challenge matters, and obstacles toward achieving this goal include: 

 - The state is not learning fast enough. Lessons learned from one project are not easily available to a project by a different group, and both regulatory and cultural barriers prevent groups from copying each other’s successful procurement and development work, so even common technology can be difficult to apply successfully. People who have been involved in similar projects are not involved in supporting the success of subsequent projects. 
 - Technology and procurement policy are experienced as “one size fits all”. Needs and problems that might easily be solved with common, standard policy or infrastructure can easily become large technology projects, even when that may not be appropriate. For example, there are many duplicate common systems (e.g. Case Management) currently in PAL that may not require so much duplication. 
 - Departments need clear, consistent policies regarding data, the use of cloud services and graded approaches to risk.  
 - Departments often negotiate their own deals for commodity technology, despite largely common needs across the state; taking precious time and resources away from other priorities.
 - Leaders recognize a need for strong institutional focus  and support for what makes programs or departmental needs exceptional instead of what is common.
The state has a unique opportunity through its size, scope and partnerships with other California entities such as local government to negotiate better value. 
 - Departments have found success and utility with vehicles like CDT’s Vendor Hosted Subscription Services (VHSS) and DGS’ Software Licensing Program (SLP) that have made it easier to buy common technology.

**Challenge 3.3: What do staff need to easily use and access the data they need? How might policy, technology, tools and infrastructure need to change to support those needs?** 
Reasons why this challenge matters, and obstacles toward achieving this goal include: 

 - Emergencies like successfully coordinating seamless evacuation require entities like CalOES, county sheriffs and emergency operations centers to share situational awareness that isn’t supported by current data infrastructure. 
 - The needs of program staff such as data scientists and analysts in terms of policy, tools, systems and infrastructure aren’t clearly understood and so their needs are not being met consistently and efficiently. 
 - Programs lack consistent, secure environments to prototype and experiment with data without affecting operations, and consistent, automated methods of deploying to production. 
 - An inconsistent, crisis-driven approach means many data problems are solved on an ad-hoc basis instead of systemically. This crisis or project driven approach means there is little to no opportunity for institutional continuous learning, and high start up costs. 
 - Across the state, processes and governance need to be harmonized so that usage, access and control of data is consistent and clear.

**Challenge 3.4: How might we reduce the burden on departments by improving the reliability, simplifying maintenance and reducing the cost of running websites?** 
Reasons why this challenge matters, and obstacles toward achieving this goal include: 

 - Commodity web hosting and publishing Infrastructure is duplicated across departments and a potential ideal candidate for standardization and centralization.
 - Public websites aren’t consistent in their ability to meet surges in demand.
 - Inconsistent web platforms, templates, and design across the state, lead to complex operations and variable user experience for Californians. 
**Challenge 3.5: How can we develop a more secure, reliable and seamless way for people to prove who they are across the State?** 
Reasons why this challenge matters, and obstacles toward achieving this goal include: 

 - The user experience of identity verification and authentication is inconsistent across services, and does not reflect the expectations of users, who see government as a single entity. 
 - Dozens of identification verification solutions exist statewide. 
 - Breakdowns in the intersection of policy, operations and technology in identity verification have created operational bottlenecks leading to unacceptably slow service delivery.
 - Work needs to be done to understand user needs and expectations about how and when government shares information, transparency and informed consent, and to develop and implement successful patterns.
 - All users and stakeholders have a right and expectation to privacy and security of their information. 




## 4. Build digital government more quickly and more effectively  
**Challenge 4.1 How can we provide practical, consistent and transparent technology project initiation and oversight that meets different stakeholder needs, from ongoing service improvement to a state-wide enterprise view for prioritization?** 
Reasons why this challenge matters, and obstacles toward achieving this goal include: 

 - Managers and CIOs expressed a desire for faster, clearer, and more lightweight project approval cycles. Delegation thresholds aren’t perceived to be set at appropriate levels. 
 - The current project initiation and oversight process is cumbersome and intrusive, which slows down the state’s ability to provide services and use modern technology. For technology implementations, this makes the difference between getting a current or an old technology.
 - Interviews with legislative staff indicated that too many improvement initiatives measure in years before changes are put into production.
 - Approval processes would be better with more coaching, consistency, and adaptability so outcomes are less dependent on individuals.
 - Project leaders need investment and support to ensure they have the right capabilities, and knowledge including from those who have led similar builds. 

**Challenge 4.2: How might we develop the information needed to create and update a state-wide roadmap, and to prioritize investment?** 
Reasons why this challenge matters, and obstacles toward achieving this goal include: 

 - The Department of Finance and the Legislature need regular visibility and confidence that we are appropriately investing and building useful technology at both the service and state-wide enterprise level.
 - An environment focused on projects has left no room to identify or support state-wide common infrastructure or shared services that would provide compound benefits for multiple projects.
**Challenge 4.3: How might we better solve large, complex, state-wide problems like legacy infrastructure modernization and long-term harmonization of infrastructure?**
Reasons why this challenge matters, and obstacles toward achieving this goal include: 
- Technology leaders expressed the need to distinguish between projects that require treatment as technology capital projects and those suited for continuous service improvement.
- Successful public and private approaches to solving large, complex, duplicated problems like operational data exchange involve solving immediate, practical problems one-by-one as part of a deliberate long-term strategy. 

**Challenge 4.4: How can we stop re-learning the same lessons? How can we accelerate progress by institutionalizing learning?**
Reasons why this challenge matters, and obstacles toward achieving this goal include: 

- There is no consistent, prioritized or adequately resourced approach to creating the technical documentation and guidance to support learning from project to project. This is required for the state to make the exponential improvement for Vision 2023. 
- Technology leaders clearly expressed the need for projects to build and apply lessons from each others’ success and failures. 
- Critical systems rely on the outstanding work of long-term government staff who are nearing retirement. 

## 5. Build confident, empowered multi-disciplinary teams
**Challenge 5.1: What do leaders need to confidently and successfully integrate program, operations and technology to continuously improve outcomes?** 
Reasons why this challenge matters, and obstacles toward achieving this goal include: 

- Executives and leaders need the confidence, support, environment and skills to lead business, operational and service transformations that are impossible without solid technology execution. 
- Limited fluency can hold back departmental progress and reinforce silos.
- Insufficient support models and practices exist today, and surveys and interviews indicate that management training doesn’t fully incorporate technology or address the needs of busy state leaders. 
- Poorly implemented and resourced technology rollouts sow distrust in new projects and approaches. 
- Siloed technology teams can at times run their own projects without a clear understanding of the business needs behind them, or sometimes vendors step in and end up driving strategy; inevitably, disconnected technology teams have their own concerns and priorities which may or may not align directly with agency priorities.

**Challenge 5.2: How can we begin building stronger, integrated, multi-disciplinary teams?** 
Reasons why this challenge matters, and obstacles toward achieving this goal include: 

- Technology is not an end in itself but rather a tool to help improve government - and successful use requires collaboration and integration across disciplines.
- We currently organize technology largely based on a historical IT structure where there is a need to “keep the lights on” and support commodity technology, even as roles have increasingly intertwined with core programs. 
- We need to show how to incorporate technology into integrated teams to help enable the type of collaborative work required to deliver. 
- Where agencies rely heavily on vendors, they often underestimate the internal technology skills needed, and just the volume of management work required for vendor projects to succeed. Managers can be effectively assigned to two jobs while a major technology project is in play: their existing responsibilities, and management of the technology project.

**Challenge 5.3: How can we better invest in and develop our technologists?**
Reasons why this challenge matters, and obstacles toward achieving this goal include: 

- Strong existing technology leadership programs exist throughout the state but surveys indicate that they don’t fully meet current needs and there are gaps in the skills and training they provide, including on-the-job learning.
- Competency models and job descriptions are inconsistent in practice. Some of this work has already started in areas like data.  
- Staff and managers are eager for additional training, and reported confidence in their ability to adapt to new technology with proper training.
- Staff feel that systems are forced on them with little or inadequate training.

**Challenge 5.4: How can we attract and retain the technology talent needed for 21st century government?**
Reasons why this challenge matters, and obstacles toward achieving this goal include: 

- We lack critical roles like user researchers, designers, technical writers and data engineers to achieve our goals and vision, and these roles are also hard to recruit for. 
- Rapid changes in technologies are changing the way we live and work - and we need the talent to help government keep up with these changes.
- Need to attract talent with a value proposition focused on service, recognizing what government can uniquely offer compared to the private sector. 
- Need to set up non-governmental talent for success by thoughtfully onboarding and integrating talent into teams with appropriate support to avoid the risk of burn out.
- When technology is not part of the hiring budgeting and planning process, technology disciplines may not be expanded enough to support the new functions or headcount.
