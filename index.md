## Executive Summary

**Vision 2023 is California’s Statewide Strategic Plan to  efficiently and effectively use technology to meet our society’s goals, and make progress on the big, complex problems that affect us all.** 

COVID-19 has reminded us how fragile our communities, businesses, and our lives are. It has shown that our government must do more to be prepared, and where public services must improve.  

This plan is the result of unprecedented participation during an incredibly difficult time. Across government, we surveyed thousands of staff and conducted over 60 interviews, including California’s legislature, local government and the civic technology and vendor community. We heard from passionate, creative public servants who will thrive with connection, direction, consistency and policies aimed for success. 

Vision 2023 tells the story of how technology powers not just more efficient and effective government, but of compassionate and humane government. Of government that just works: without surprises, hidden traps, or getting lost in mazes of hundreds of departments. Of government that is easy to use, accessible and reliable when it’s needed. And of government that openly shares, listens to, understands, and responds to what people need and desire.

To achieve our vision, we must put people first, make continuous, timely improvement and recognize that working together beats working alone. These are our guiding principles, the bedrock of how we must use technology.
