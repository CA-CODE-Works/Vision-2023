# 2. Ensure public services are equitable and inclusive

>“It feels like we assume the public are  upper-middle-class white people with college degrees.”
User research interview with Christian Griffith, Chief Consultant, Assembly Budget Committee, Government Operations Agency

In California, nearly 16 million Californians speak a language instead of English or in addition to English. But many public services can appear to people as if they are designed for upper-middle-class, English speaking people first, and as if the most vulnerable Californians as an afterthought. 

Around 23% of adult Californians have some kind of disability. Throughout our lives, most of us will experience disability, whether permanently or temporarily. Assembly Bill 434 recognized this, by requiring government websites to comply with industry and federal accessibility standards. But being inclusive and accessible to all is more complicated than complying with rules. 

COVID-19 illustrated how changes to procurement -- dropping the requirement for vendors to be on-site -- opened up the state to vendors who are normally excluded. 

Technology supporting equity and inclusion means services are just as easy and fast for Sofia to use with English as a second language and limited mobility. Leticia and Gina, with their three children have internet access that’s affordable, fast and reliable enough if working from home or home schooling. Widespread internet access means Erika gets her fishing permit from her phone at the river, instead of needing to remember to get it before she drives out in the morning. 

When diverse teams and vendors representative of our State are supported to research and listen to people like Sofia, Leticia, Gina and Erika from the start of their work, our public services will better reflect and meet the needs of the people they serve.
