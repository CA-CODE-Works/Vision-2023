# About Vision 2023
`This is the repository for vision2023.cdt.ca.gov`

Vision 2023 is California’s Statewide Strategic Plan to efficiently and effectively use technology to meet our society’s goals, and make progress on the big, complex problems affecting us all. 

Vision 2023 lays out how technology powers not just more efficient and effective government, but a compassionate and fair government. Our vision is of a government that operates without surprises or hidden traps. It is a convenient, accessible and reliable government and one that hears its people’s voices and reacts to their needs and desires. 

In the next three years and beyond, our [goals](https://vision2023.cdt.ca.gov/goals/) are to: 

* Deliver easy-to-use, fast, dependable and secure public services.
* Ensure public services are equitable and inclusive.
* Make common technology easy to access, use, and reuse across government.
* Build digital government more quickly and more effectively. 
* Build confident, empowered multi-disciplinary teams.

We will achieve our vision by working toward these goals and applying our guiding [principles](https://vision2023.cdt.ca.gov/principles/): to put people first, make continuous, timely improvement and recognize that working together beats working alone.
